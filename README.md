### 1.Brief Project Description
The project is called handwritten digit recognition. It is the ability of a computer system to recognize the handwritten inputs such as digits in this project. The main goal is to use this project to get familiar with some popular methods in Machine Learning. KNN, SVM and RFC will be used in this project. Here is my [project proposal](Yin Ming_Proposal.pdf).

### 2.Dataset
The MNIST Database of handwriting digits.Four files are available on this site:

* train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz:  training set images (9912422 bytes) 
* train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz:  training set labels (28881 bytes) 
* t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz:   test set images (1648877 bytes) 
* t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz:   test set labels (4542 bytes)

### 3.Methods
KNN, SVM and RFC are used to get the classifier accuracy and prediction accuracy.

* [Python notebook file: SVM Classifier](SVM Method.ipynb)
* [Python notebook file: RFC Classifier](Random Forest Classifier.ipynb)

### 4.Project Report
Here is my project presentation. The report contains all details about the project and the results.

* [Project Presentation PPT: Report](Project Report.pdf)

### 5.Conclusion
According to the results of the three methods, SVM has the highest training classifier accuracy and prediction accuracy. While SVM has the longest training and testing time as well.
